# The final data story

https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/strategic-plan-copy-2/index.html



# Changes made since Part II
During the presentation, I realized that most people were unfamiliar with Bilibili. To address this, I added a new page in my storyboard to introduce the platform. I also included Bilibili’s logo in the introduction section. The image not only helps identify the platform but also serves as a moodboard reference, explaining the choice of pink and blue tones used in the later charts. Finally, I added short written explanations below each chart in the presentation version of the storyboard to make the visual data easier to understand.



## The audience
My target audience is quite specific. It includes current dance content creators on Bilibili, individuals who plan to become creators in the future, and dance-related arts organizations. By providing insights into Bilibili’s dissemination patterns and recommendations on video characteristics, this aims to help them build stronger personal brands, enhance audience engagement, and improve their overall visibility on the platform.




## Final design decisions
The final structure of my story is organized as follows.
① First, it introduces the topic to the target audience and offers clear recommendations for current and future dance video creators on Bilibili to better connect with viewers.


② Second, it provides background information about the Bilibili platform and its user landscape.


③ Third, it presents three key video characteristics and explains how each affects the dissemination of dance videos.


④ Finally, it ends with a summary and a call to action, highlighting three recommended video strategies for creators to apply in their future uploads.

# Final thoughts
In the “video release time” section, I wanted to include an additional dataset showing Bilibili users’ viewing habits and compare their most active browsing hours with the release-time results from my analysis. However, I did not have enough time or data to complete this part.

Across all my charts, I relied mainly on average values. I realized that extreme values might have influenced some of the conclusions. I initially experimented with box plots to represent data more accurately, but after discussing with several friends from the dance community, I found that many of them were unfamiliar with this type of visualization and found it difficult to interpret. As a result, I decided to keep simple bar charts using median values for clarity. In the future, I hope to find better ways to balance accuracy and accessibility in my visual storytelling.
