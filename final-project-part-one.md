# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
In this digital era, characterized by the convergence of "mobile + social + video", new media has created both opportunities and challenges for the dissemination of dance. Social video platforms have become crucial channels for dance enthusiasts, professional dancers, and dance institutions to showcase their talents, share educational resources, build personal or organizational brands, and promote cultural dissemination.

Among China’s leading content-driven platforms, Bilibili stands out as one of the most active online communities for young people. Its dance section is vibrant, marked by diverse content creation, broad audience participation, and strong potential for creators to establish personal brands and monetize their work. Furthermore, due to the platform’s historical development and unique positioning, Bilibili audiences are more receptive to long-form and high-quality content, making it a favorable environment for dance video dissemination.

As both a dance enthusiast with 18 years of training, an art manager, and a passionate Bilibili user, I am interested in leverage data to uncover patterns in how dance videos circulate on the platform. While compelling content is undeniably central, other controllable factors, such as video length and upload timing, also influence performance metrics. This project seeks to identify those factors and provide data-based strategies for dance creators to enhance the reach and impact of their work.

# The data
The dataset used in this project can be found here:  
👉 [data-final-project.xlsx](data/data-final-project.xlsx)

Based on the current development of Bilibili’s dance section, I used the number of fans and video views as the main criteria, and with reference to the official Bilibili Top 100 Creator lists (2018–2023) & the Bilibili Dance Section Rankings (2018–2023). I selected 30 top dance uploaders on the platform as research subjects. I collected a total of 7,081 data entries, including uploaders' names, number of fans, and all videos they have published, covering video duration, upload time, likes, views, coins (Note: The number of “coins” is one of Bilibili’s unique feedback mechanisms. Users can choose to give 1 or 2 Bilibili coins to a specific video as a way to show their support and appreciation), comments, favorites, and shares. All of these data were collected in 2024 through a web scraping tool called Octopus Data Collector, with data collection completed by June 8.

I will:
> (1) Provide a descriptive analysis to briefly introduce the development of these 30 top uploaders, including each uploader’s total number of fans, total number of published videos, and total views.
> (2) Analyze the impact of fan count on total views and coins.
> (3) Examine the controllable factors for video creators. Explore the video duration & upload time and their relationship with video performance metrics, including views, likes, favorites, coins, comments, and shares,  to identify suitable publishing strategies --- a. Whether video duration influences views, favorites, and comments; b. Whether the time of publication affects views, likes, and shares.
> (4) Finally, provide operational recommendations for dance related video creators.


# Method and medium
I will use Tableau to create the data visualizations and Shorthand to present the final project.

## AI acknowledgements
I used ChatGPT to help me complete the sketching part of the project.
