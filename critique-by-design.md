# Critique & Design

## Step one: the visualization
I selected this data visualization from MakeOverMonday. The Original link is: https://resume.io/blog/which-country-gets-the-most-paid-vacation-days
<img width="2400" height="2614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f2cca00-9faf-4926-b86a-56c294e14938" />

I chose it because the topic is very interesting, and is closely related to our lives. I was immediately attracted by the design. It is engaging and vivid, with clear strengths such as using a world map to directly show paid vacation days across countries. At the same time, it has some obvious weaknesses. For example, too many lines distract the viewer and make the chart look cluttered. Besides, since it contains a large amount of data, there is plenty of room for adjustment and improvement.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

I think the original visualization provides a broad, general understanding of the number of paid vacation days worldwide. However, I want my redesigned chart to be more intuitive for job seekers, job hoppers, or immigrants who may consider paid vacation days as an important factor in their career decisions.

Therefore, I plan to use a bar chart, sorted in descending order by the number of paid vacation days. I will calculate the global average of paid vacation days and use it as a benchmark: countries above the average will be highlighted in blue, while those below the average will be highlighted in yellow. The color would be gradient to indicate the relative number of days within each group. This way, the audience can easily observe the global distribution of paid vacation days and make comparisons with their own country.

## Step four: Test the solution

During class, I received critiques from my peers on my sketch.

Since my sketch did not include any textual information, I had to verbally explain the meaning of the chart. This increased the difficulty for everyone to immediately understand both the visualization and the data. And we have walk through some problems together:
1. The current arrangement made it difficult to clearly see comparisons or differences at first glance.
2. The large amount of data placed in the chart made it hard to quickly extract useful insights.
3. Several people pointed out that categorizing the data by region would make the visualization easier to read and more meaningful as we can compared different region.
4. The biggest debate was about the value of this visualization. Some believed the data simply aimed to show the number of paid vacation days across countries, which was enough. Others argued that only showing paid vacation days was not useful and that additional contextual data should be introduced. And this led to another discussion: if more data should be added, what kind of data would make the visualization more meaningful?

After the discussion, I decided to make the following changes for my final visualization:
1. Create a story-driven and engaging title so that readers can quickly understand the purpose and meaning of the chart.
2. Group the data by region and keep only a selected portion of the data. By reducing the amount of data shown, the visualization will become clearer and easier to read.
3. Introduce an additional dataset that connects meaningfully with paid vacation days, so that the visualization is not only descriptive but also more useful for interpretation and decision-making.
